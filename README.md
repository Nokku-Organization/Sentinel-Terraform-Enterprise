# Sentinel-Terraform-Enterprise
Sentinel-Terraform-Enterprise is for managing terraform-enterprise by making restrictions via policies

Terraform Enterprise is our self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud. It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

Sentinel is an embeddable policy as code framework to enable fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions that can be extended to source external information to make decisions
